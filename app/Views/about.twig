                <p> Deree students have always been wondering about who the best professor for a
                    specific course is, who is knowledgeable, who is lenient,
                    etc.</p>

                <p>This site was created, <u>for the students by the students</u>, to address exactly this
                    need.</p>

                <p> Members are able to evaluate ("Judge")
                    professors and make comments about them.<br> Both members and non-members are able to see statistics
                    about the professors, as well as background information, and
                    comments made by other students.</p>
                <p>Of course, <b>everyone remains anonymous.</b> </p>
                <p></p>

                <p>Enjoy!</p>
